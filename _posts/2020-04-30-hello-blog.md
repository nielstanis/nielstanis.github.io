title: Hello Blog!
---

Welcome to the first post on my blog, with definitely a lot more to follow! I've been thinking about doing this for a while and realized that this is the right moment to start one. Over the last years I've done a lot of speaking on various topics and with this blog I'm going to take it a bit further with sharing more content more frequently. 

What will I write about? Because I work as a security researcher for [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com) and as the subtitle of the blog indicates, it will _mostly_ be about application/software security and .NET. But definitely won't mean it will be _exclusively_ about that. Lately I've been playing around with Rust and really enjoying it. Same counts for all things happening around WebAssembly, which of course is not only limited to [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). Want to know more about me? Go to the [About]({% link about.md %}) page for that.

Hope to see you back soon! You can always start following me on Twitter [@nielstanis](https://twitter.com/nielstanis) where I'll also share if there is new content available. And on the page about [Speaking]({% link speaking.md}) you can find links to the content of the talks I've given in the past.
